Welcome to PCAT's documentation!
================================

PCAT is a hierarchical, transdimensional MCMC sampler. It can be used to sample from the **catalog space**, i.e., the hypothesis space of a model with a variable number of components given some observed data. Alternatively, it can be used as a general purpose Poisson mixture sampler to infer clusters in a dataset.
